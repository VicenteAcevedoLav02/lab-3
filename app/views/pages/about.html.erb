I don't know how to fill this, so im gonna tell a joke.
<br>
"A bear enters a bar and tells the bartender:
<br>
"May I have a glass of whisky...
<br>
...
<br>
...
<br>
and a rum with coke"
<br>

The bartender asks
<br>
"Why the big pause?"
<br>
Then, the bear answers
<br>

"I don't know, I was born with them"
<br>
"
